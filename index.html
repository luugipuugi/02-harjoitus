        How does one punch out the corner of an element and put something in the
        space created?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Answer: you don't, at least not structurally. But the appearance can be
        achieved very easily just by using floated elements and, when necessary,
        some tiny negative margins. In this example, I've wrapped the "Q" in a
        div of its own and then floated the div over. Then I give the float some
        nice padding and margins, and center the character. Finally, I set thick
        white borders on the float, which matches nicely with the white document
        background-- but only the right and bottom borders are made thick. The
        top and left borders are set to zero. To wit:
      </p>
      <pre>
div#punch {float: left; font-size: 500%; width: 1.2em;
text-align: center; padding: 0.1em 0.1em 0;
background: #568; color: white; border: solid white 1px; 
border-width: 0 0.2em 0.2em 0; margin: 0 0.5em 0.2em 0;}</pre>
       <p>
        It all adds up to the appearance of a block that's had a corner punched
        out and replaced, and the text in the block reflowed to go around the
        punchout. And, in a sense, that's exactly what happened. But what if I
        want to put a border around the main block of text? How do I keep it
        from encircling my punched-out corner? Even worse, how do I get that
        border to run along the edge of the punchout?

        <p>So we can do it after all! (Assuming we aren't using IE5.x/Win or IE6/Win, that is, which isn't able to keep up. If you want to see the variant that does work in IE/Win, go ahead.) Notice how the border of the main div is bent out of a rectangle so that it runs inside the floated element. Okay, I'm lying. That isn't what's really happening. Instead, I set one-pixel black borders on the right and bottom edges of the float, and no border at all on the top and left edges. Then the float is pulled one pixel up and one pixel to the left, which is accomplished by setting -1px margins on those sides. This causes the float to overlap the border set on the main div, thus covering up the black border with the white background of the float. The code looks like this:

            </span>
        </figure>
        <p>"Better to stick to what's needed."It's the same basic principle as before, only this time we need to draw three of the borders and only pull the float one pixel to the left. We could keep pulling it one pixel upward as well, but that's no necessary here and could (in theory) lead to complications. Better to stick to what's needed. Again, any element could be floated, so you could float links for further reading, more decorative images like folder tabs, a list of short ideas or points that are related to the main text, a table of figures, or the familiar "pull quote" style of taking a short phrase in the text and repeating it in larger text. Like we see here. 
        </p>
        <pre>div#punch3b {float: right; width: 25%; text-align: left; 
            font-size: 140%; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; 
            padding: 1em; text-indent: -0.5em; background: white; 
            color: black; border: solid black 1px;
            border-width: 1px 0 1px 1px; margin: 0.2em -1px 0.2em 0.5em;}</pre>
        <p>Note that, due to rounding errors, Mozilla (and thus Netscape 6.x) may not move a right-floated element over as far as it should be. If you resize your browser window enough times, you'll see a black border appear to the right of the pull quote. That's because the float is one pixel too far to the left, and the main div's border becomes visible. Hopefully they'll fix that eventually. 
        </p>
            <p>There are any number of ways this concept could be extended, really. The only limit is your imagination! And negative margins don't have to be restricted to floats, either. Consider this fairly irregular-looking page and how it's been created. Some floats, some normal-flow elements, a few one-pixel negative margins, and you've got some twisty layouts! I just hope Wired doesn't sue me for stylistic theft...
